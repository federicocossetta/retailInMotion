# Demo
Simple consideration on demo project

* Data could be given in a better format than XML, maybe json or protobuffer could suite better
* Data could be formatted in a better way : to check if there are no forecast, message is present inside a ``tram`` XML node
* For better UI also abbreviation of destination could be included in data
* API could take additional parameters to see only Inbound or Outbound to avoid useless data transfer and useless parsing operations
